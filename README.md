# KTA 

KTA (KTH's Timing Analyzer) is a tool for static analysis of C and machine code. Currently, only the MIPS32 ISA is supported. The current version of KTA can perform two types of analysis:

* **Interactive Timing Analysis:** The tool takes as input a `.ta` timing analysis file that contains information about what kind of analysis that should be done. The interactive timing analysis is intended to be used together with the [KIELER project](http://www.rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/research/kieler/). The interactive timing analysis is experimental and performs an exhaustive search. For more information, see the following [paper](https://people.kth.se/~dbro/papers/fuhrmann-et-al-2016-time-for-reactive-modeling.pdf).  

* **Abstract Search-based WCET Analysis:** This analysis is under development. The goal is to provide efficient optimal WCET analysis for simple cache-based RISC processors. 

## Installation

KTA should be possible to be executed on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, but it has only been extensively tested on Mac OS X. To install the program, perform the following:

1. Install the latest version of the OCaml compiler. See  [ocaml.org](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html) for installation instructions. 

2. Install the [MCB32 tool chain](https://github.com/is1200-example-projects/mcb32tools/releases/). Follow the instruction on the link, but do not test the environment according to the instructions since it requires the use of a PIC32 hardware platform.

3. Launch the MCB32 command line terminal (see the link in step 2). If you have started the terminal correctly, the command line should show `[mcb32]`. 

4. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/timed-c/kta.git`

5. From the root path, run: `make`. An executable named `kta` should now be available in the directory `./bin`. Add this directory to your path environment.

## Usage

* Please see the following [getting started guide](doc/gettingstarted.md) for an informal introduction on how to use the tool.

* Please see the [design overview](doc/design.md) document for a brief overview of the design and implementation of KTA.

## Benchmarks

### MDH Benchmarks
The [MDH benchmarks](http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/projects/wcet/benchmarks.html) are included in the test/wcet\_tests/mdh folder.

### TACLe Benchmarks
The [TACLe Benchmark Suite](http://www.tacle.eu/index.php/activities/taclebench) is available at the git repository: [tacle-bench.git](https://github.com/tacle/tacle-bench.git). In the current version of KTA, git commit fcabf4630cb239f34f37a03ce7d93c563b65c897 is used.
